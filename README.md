Github Traffic Light
==============

An Arduino program to control a traffic light that mirrors the status of status.github.com

###What is this?

This is a little program I wrote that utilises an Arduino (ATMega328p) and Ethernet hardware (a WizNet WIZ820io) to control three lights that mirror the color of the banner on status.github.com. So now you know, without even opening a new webpage, whether the reason you can't push/pull to/from GitHub is your fault or not.

###Here be *Smallish* Dragons

Be warned, this is ~~extremely~~ slightly janky code.
We assume that the https://status.github.com/api/status.json file will always exist

Janky-ness has been reduced.
